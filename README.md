# Belly-Button_Challenge

Greetings!

Welcome to the 'Belly-Button_Challenge' Repository. This challenge utilized JSON data to explore a belly button biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels and subsequently generate a JavaScript dashboard. The Repository structure is listed below:

---'index.html': html file utilizing .js file for page generation

---'samples.json': a .json file representing the dataset locally, although a URL was utilized within code

---'static': Repository containing a directory 'js' which contians the main JavaScript code for the dashboard ('app.js')


Cheers!
